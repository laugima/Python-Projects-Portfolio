# Python-Projects-Portfolio
 Here you will find Python projects that have been created as part of my Portfolio.


# 1. BMI Calculator
Description:
This project involves creating a Python tool to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual. The program takes the user's weight and height as input and computes the BMI using the standard formula (weight in kg / height in meters squared). The results are displayed along with a health classification based on the BMI value, following the categories of the World Health Organization (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity).


# 2. **Building an Automated File Sorter in File Explorer**
Description:
This project automates the organization of files in the system's file explorer. Using Python and its library, the program scans a specific folder for unordered files and moves them into predefined subfolders based on their type (e.g., images, text, xlsx). This project aims to simplify file management and improve efficiency in environments with large amounts of data.


# 3. **Scraping Data from a Real Website**
Description:
In this project, web scraping is performed to gather information from a Wikipedia page about the largest companies in the United States. Using Python's `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries, the script extracts relevant data such as company names, sectors, revenue, etc., and organizes the information into a tabular format with Pandas. The goal is to create a detailed table containing up-to-date data on the top companies in the U.S.


# 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis in Pandas**
Description:
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using an Excel file containing data on world population and tourism. The data is loaded into Pandas, and various tables are created to explore specific patterns such as population distribution. Through visualizations and summary statistics, this project provides insights into global demographic and tourism data.
