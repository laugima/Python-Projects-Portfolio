### [**1. BMI Calculator**](https://github.com/laugima/Python-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/1.%20Building%20a%20BMI%20Calculator.ipynb)
This project involves creating a Python tool to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of an individual. The program takes the user's weight and height as input and computes the BMI using the standard formula (weight in kg / height in meters squared). The results are displayed along with a health classification based on the BMI value, following the categories of the World Health Organization (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity).


### [**2. Building an Automated File Sorter in File Explorer**](https://github.com/laugima/Python-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/2.%20Building%20an%20Automated%20File%20Sorter%20in%20File%20Explorer.ipynb)
This project automates the organization of files in the system's file explorer. Using Python and its library, the program scans a specific folder for unordered files and moves them into predefined subfolders based on their type (e.g., images, text, xlsx). This project aims to simplify file management and improve efficiency in environments with large amounts of data.


### [**3.Web Scraping for Business Intelligence: Extracting Market Data from the Web**](https://github.com/laugima/Python-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/3.%20Web%20Scraping%20for%20Business%20Intelligence:%20Extracting%20Market%20Data%20from%20the%20Web.ipynb)
In today's data-driven world, businesses rely on real-time market data to stay competitive. This project uses Python & BeautifulSoup to scrape structured information from a real website, turning unstructured web data into actionable business insights.  

## **Key Features & Process**  
- **Data Collection** ‚Äì Extracted key metrics such as company rankings, market trends, or financial data.  
- **Data Cleaning & Structuring** ‚Äì Processed raw HTML data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.  
- **Export & Integration** ‚Äì Stored the data in CSV format for further analysis in Excel, Power BI, or databases.  
- **Business Applications** ‚Äì Potential use cases include competitor analysis, price monitoring, and industry benchmarking.  

## **Business Impact**  
‚úÖ **Helps businesses track competitors & industry trends** in real-time.  
‚úÖ **Automates data collection**, reducing manual research efforts.  
‚úÖ **Supports market research & financial decision-making** with live web data.  

## **Technologies Used**  
üõ†Ô∏è Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Requests  


### [**4. **Exploratory Data Analysis in Pandas**](https://github.com/laugima/Python-Projects-Portfolio/blob/main/4.%20Data-Driven%20Decision%20Making:%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA)%20in%20Pandas.ipynb)
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Pandas & Matplotlib**, uncovering key trends from a real-world dataset. EDA is a crucial step in **business analytics, finance, and operations** for identifying patterns and making data-driven decisions.  

## **Key Features & Process**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** ‚Äì Handled missing values, outliers, and formatted data for consistency.  
- **Descriptive Statistics** ‚Äì Analyzed key metrics such as revenue, customer trends, or operational performance.  
- **Data Visualization** ‚Äì Created graphs & charts to highlight business insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
- **Actionable Insights** ‚Äì Identified correlations, trends, and patterns relevant to business strategy.  

## **Business Impact**  
‚úÖ **Supports data-driven decision-making** by revealing insights from raw data.  
‚úÖ **Improves operational efficiency** by detecting bottlenecks or inefficiencies.  
‚úÖ **Helps in forecasting & market strategy development** using historical trends.  

## **Technologies Used**  
üõ†Ô∏è Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
